911 Calls for Service 2020

Overview-

In recent years, crime rates have been rising and so is the number of 911 calls received. A quick response to any 911 call is essential in such circumstances. With this in mind, processing all 911 calls for any kind of emergency becomes important. By figuring out trends between time and day of the week and the form of calls received, this can be done.The dataset I am using is about 911 calls and is accessible through the website of Baltimore open data. In this research, I had the opportunity to look closely at 911 calls, which places are most affected and their reasoning for it. 911 is an important resource and doing the analysis of this data would be helpful for communities and 911 operators.

Project Goal-

As per my study, a total of 1.46M calls were reported in the year 2020 alone through 911. The goal of this project is to check different types of reports made and try to identify a pattern between them and to determine the highest numbers of call for which reason. I will accomplish this goal by using Neural Network techniques, random forest, linear regression, logistic regression and Exploratory Data Analysis. This research will prove helpful to guide current services for improvement and to determine them on the areas most affected and prone to have an incident report.

Motivation-

In the current scenario, for every panic reason people tend to call 911 for all type of emergiencies.It is not always feasible as it becomes difficult to understand to which department is the call referring to and hence it becomes difficult to respond to those calls with minimum response time. Thus, the speed and accuracy of the algotihm plays an important factor. It is essential to have a thorough understanding of the data to help the responders mitigate the time and energy spend otherwise and to direct them to the incident as quickly as possible.
